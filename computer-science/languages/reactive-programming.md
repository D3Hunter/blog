Reactive programming is simply to program using, and relying on, events. instead of the order of lines in the code. Usually this involves more than one event, and those events happen in a sequence over time.

`Mono` and `Flux` are both reactive streams. They differ in what they express. A `Mono` is a stream of 0 to 1 element, whereas a `Flux` is a stream of 0 to N elements.
