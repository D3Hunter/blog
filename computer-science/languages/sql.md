the default is `INNER JOIN` if you just specify `JOIN`.

`CARTESIAN JOIN`: The `CARTESIAN JOIN` is also known as `CROSS JOIN`. In a `CARTESIAN JOIN` there is a join for each row of one table to every row of another table.

By the SQL standard, a `foreign key` must reference either the `primary key` or a `unique key` of the parent table. If the primary key has multiple columns, the foreign key must have the same number and order of columns.

Any `primary key` must be `unique` and `non-null`.

If you don't specify an `ORDER BY`, then there is NO ORDER defined.
