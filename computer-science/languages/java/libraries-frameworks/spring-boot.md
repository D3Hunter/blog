Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

spring-boot或者调用`getLocalHost`特别慢，将`hostname`放到`/etc/hosts`中的`127.0.0.1`和`::1`的映射中

### Features
- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration
- Automatically configure Spring whenever possible
- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
