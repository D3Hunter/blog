## DevOps
`DevOps`: a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality.

As `DevOps` is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, those who practice the methodology use different sets of tools—referred to as "`toolchains`". Some categories are more essential in a `DevOps` toolchain than others; especially `continuous integration` (e.g. `Jenkins`, `Gitlab`, `Bitbucket` pipelines) and `infrastructure as code` (e.g., `Terraform`, `Ansible`, `Puppet`).
- Coding – code development and review, source code management tools, code merging.
- Building – `continuous integration` tools, build status.
- Testing – `continuous testing` tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks.
- Packaging – artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging.
- Releasing – change management, release approvals, release automation.
- Configuring – infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools.
- Monitoring – applications performance monitoring, end-user experience.

`Agile` and `DevOps` serve complementary roles: several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world. `Agile` can be viewed as addressing `communication gaps between customers and developers`, while `DevOps` addresses `gaps between developers and IT operations / infrastructure`. Also, `DevOps` has focus on the `deployment` of developed software, whether it is developed via Agile or other methodologies.

## Infrastructure as code (IaC)
`Infrastructure as code (IaC)` is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

`IaC` can be a key attribute of enabling best practices in `DevOps` – Developers become more involved in defining configuration and Ops teams get involved earlier in the development process.
