`LLVM` is strongly typed with a simple type system

Another significant difference from machine code is that the `LLVM IR` doesn't use a fixed set of named registers, it uses an infinite set of temporaries named with a % character.

`LLVM IR` is actually defined in three isomorphic forms: the `textual format` above, an `in-memory data structure` inspected and modified by optimizations themselves, and an efficient and dense on-disk binary "`bitcode`" format.

A `Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL)`, also known as an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.
