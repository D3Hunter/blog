### concepts related to parser
concepts in scope: mathematics, computer science, linguistics and formal language theory
- `LL`: Left to right, performing Leftmost derivation
- An `LL parser` is called an `LL(k) parser` if it uses `k` tokens of lookahead when parsing a sentence. A grammar is called an `LL(k) grammar` if an `LL(k)` parser exists that can parse sentences belonging to the language that the grammar generates without backtracking.
- `a formal language` is a set of strings of symbols together with a set of rules that are specific to it. A formal language is often defined by means of a `formal grammar` such as a `regular grammar` or `context-free grammar`, also called its `formation rule`.
- `Well-formedness` is the quality of a clause, word, or other linguistic element that conforms to the grammar of the language of which it is a part. Well-formed words or phrases are grammatical, meaning they obey all relevant rules of grammar. In contrast, a form that violates some grammar rule is `ill-formed` and does not constitute part of the language.
- `formal language` consists of words whose letters are taken from an alphabet and are `well-formed` according to a specific set of rules.
- `grammar` (when the context is not given, often called a `formal grammar` for clarity) is a set of production rules for strings in a formal language.
- `context-free grammar (CFG)` is a certain type of formal grammar. In `context-free grammars`, all rules are one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-none. These rules can be applied regardless of context. The left-hand side of the production rule is always a `nonterminal` symbol. This means that the symbol does not appear in the resulting formal language.
- Languages generated by `context-free grammars` are known as `context-free languages (CFL)`. Different `context-free grammars` can generate the same `context-free language`. It is important to distinguish the properties of the language (`intrinsic properties`) from the properties of a particular grammar (`extrinsic properties`).
- `LALR parser` or `Look-Ahead LR parser` is a simplified version of a `canonical LR parser`.
- `canonical LR parser` or `LR(1) parser` is an `LR(k) parser` for `k = 1`, i.e. with a single lookahead terminal.
- `LR parsers` are a type of `bottom-up parser` that efficiently read `deterministic context-free languages`, in guaranteed `linear time`.
- A `sentential form` is any string derivable from the start symbol
- A `derivation` of a string for a grammar is a sequence of grammar rule applications that transform the start symbol into the string. A derivation proves that the string belongs to the grammar's language.
    - A `derivation` is fully determined by giving, for each step:
        - which non-terminal in the sentential form to apply a production rule to
        - which production rule for that non-terminal to apply
    - `top-down parse`是leftmost，`bottom-up parse`是`reverse rightmost derivation`
    - `Rightmost derivation` has very large memory requirements
    - `leftmost derivation` and `rightmost derivation`影响grammar中的代码执行顺序，需注意

### parser classification
不同的文章概念表述略有差异
- Top-down Parser
    - `Recursive descent parser` or `Brute force parser` or `the with backtracking parser`. 具体实现上可以不用递归
    - `Non-recursive descent parser` or `LL(1) parser` or `predictive parser` or `without backtracking parser` or `dynamic parser`. 具体实现上可以用递归
        - `Predictive parsing` is possible only for the class of `LL(k)` grammars. 
        - 一般说的`LL parser`指的就是这种
        - 一般使用一个`Table`，根据当前`non-terminal`和`lookahead`确定目标`production`. 这是个优化方法，避免将其硬编码到parser，少量的grammar改动就导致大量parser代码改动，在`LR parser`中也常用到
        - 可使用`ANTLR`、`JavaCC`自动生成
- Bottom-up Parser (uses `reverse right most derivation`)
    - LR parser
        - `LR(0)`
        - `SLR(1)`
        - `LALR(1)`
        - `CLR(1)`
    - Operator precedence parser
        - 计算器使用该parser将中缀算数运算表达式转为`Reverse Polish notation (RPN)`形式
        - 包含`shunting yard`和`operator precedence climbing`

### concepts related to code optimization
- `peephole optimization` is a kind of optimization performed over a very small set of instructions in a segment of generated code. The set is called a "peephole" or a "window". It works by recognizing sets of instructions that can be replaced by shorter or faster sets of instructions.
- `basic block` is a straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit. This restricted form makes a basic block highly amenable to analysis. Compilers usually decompose programs into their basic blocks as a first step in the analysis process. `Basic blocks` form the vertices or nodes in a control flow graph.
- `static single assignment` form (often abbreviated as SSA form or simply SSA) is a property of an intermediate representation (IR), which requires that each variable is assigned exactly once, and every variable is defined before it is used.
- `induction variable` is a variable that gets increased or decreased by a fixed amount on every iteration of a loop or is a linear function of another induction variable.
