When people talk about functional programming, they mention a dizzying number of “functional” characteristics. They mention:
- language features that aid functional programming.
    - immutable data
    - first class functions
    - tail call optimisation.
- programming techniques used to write functional code.
    - mapping
    - reducing
    - pipelining
    - recursing
    - currying
    - higher order functions.
- advantageous properties of functional programs.
    - parallelization
    - lazy evaluation
    - determinism.

Functional code is characterised by one thing: `the absence of side effects`. It doesn’t rely on data outside the current function, and it doesn’t change data that exists outside the current function. Every other “functional” thing can be derived from this property. Use it as a guide rope as you learn.
