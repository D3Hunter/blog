### concepts
In probability and statistics, a `probability mass function (pmf)` is a function that gives the probability that a `discrete random variable` is exactly equal to some value.

A probability mass function differs from a `probability density function (pdf)` in that the latter is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables; the values of the `probability density function` are not probabilities as such: a pdf must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability.

The `mode` of a set of data values is the value that appears most often. It is the value `x` at which its probability mass function takes its maximum value.
A `mode` of a `continuous probability distribution` is often considered to be any value `x` at which its `probability density function` has a locally maximum value, so any peak is a mode

In mathematics, a `moment` is a specific quantitative measure, used in both mechanics and statistics, of the shape of a set of points.

Given random variables X, Y, ..., that are defined on a probability space, the `joint probability distribution` for X, Y, ... is a probability distribution that gives the probability that each of X, Y, ... falls in any particular range or discrete set of values specified for that variable. In the case of only two random variables, this is called a `bivariate distribution`, but the concept generalizes to any number of random variables, giving a `multivariate distribution`.

A `sigmoid function` is a mathematical function having a characteristic `"S"-shaped curve` or `sigmoid curve`. Often, sigmoid function refers to the special case of the `logistic function`.
A `logistic function` or `logistic curve` is a common "S" shape (sigmoid curve)

A square matrix that is not invertible is called `singular` or `degenerate`. 

In probability theory and statistics, a sequence or other collection of random variables are `independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)` if each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent.

In statistics, a `statistic is sufficient` with respect to a statistical model and its associated unknown parameter if "no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter"

In probability theory and statistics, the `binomial distribution` with parameters `n` and `p` is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of `n` independent experiments.

conjugate(/ˈkɒndʒʊɡət/): Joined in a reciprocal relation, especially having the same real parts and equal magnitudes but opposite signs of imaginary parts.

In the mathematical field of topology, a `homeomorphism` or `topological isomorphism` or `bi continuous function` is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function.

In mathematics, a `manifold` is a topological space that locally resembles `Euclidean space` near each point. More precisely, each point of an n-dimensional manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n. In this more precise terminology, a manifold is referred to as an `n-manifold`.

In geometry, a `simplex` (plural: simplexes or simplices) is a generalization of the notion of a `triangle` or `tetrahedron` to arbitrary dimensions. Specifically, a `k-simplex` is a k-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its k + 1 vertices.

In statistics, a `unimodal probability distribution` or `unimodal distribution` is a probability distribution which has a single peak. If there is a single mode, the distribution function is called "`unimodal`".

In geometry, `bisection` is the division of something into two equal or congruent parts, usually by a line, which is then called a `bisector`. A `line segment bisector` passes through the midpoint of the segment. Particularly important is the `perpendicular bisector` of a segment, which, according to its name, meets the segment at right angles.
