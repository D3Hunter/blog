.app扩展名不执行，得用.scpt
默认没有Scripts菜单，需要`~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/Scripts`下有脚本，才会出现该菜单

### Preferences
In `Profiles->Terminal` uncheck `Save lines to scrollback in alternate screen mode` and `Disable save/restore alternate screen` to make sure `less` and `vim` etc doesn't save its content to scrollback.
