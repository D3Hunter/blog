`Typesetting` is the composition of text by means of arranging physical types or the digital equivalents.

- `alignment` or `range` is the setting of text flow or image placement relative to a `page`, `column` (measure), `table cell`, or `tab`. The `type alignment setting` is sometimes referred to as `text alignment`, `text justification`, or `type justification`.
- The edge of a page or column is known as a `margin`, and a gap between columns is known as a `gutter`.
- Some modern typesetting programs offer four justification options: `left justify`, `right justify`, `center justify` and `full justify`.
- `justification` is a common type of text alignment, where the spaces between words and between glyphs or letters are stretched or compressed in order to align both the left and right ends of consecutive lines of text
