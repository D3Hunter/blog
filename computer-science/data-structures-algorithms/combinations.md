The number of `k-combinations` from a given set S of n elements notably occurs as a coefficient in the binomial formula, hence its name binomial coefficient

A `k-combination with repetitions`, or `k-multicombination`, or multisubset of size k from a set S is given by a sequence of k not necessarily distinct elements of S, where order is not taken into account
