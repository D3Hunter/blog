### 星期来源
古巴比伦人建造七星坛祭祀星神。七星坛分7层，每层有一个星神，从上到下依此为日、月、火、水、木、金、土7个神。
传到罗马后，古罗马人用他们自己信仰的神的名字来命名1周7天：
Sun\'s-day（日）
Moon\'s-day（月）
Mars\'s-day: （火）玛尔斯（Mars）对应阿瑞斯（Ares）：战争之神
Mercury\'s-day: （水）墨丘利（Mercury）对应赫尔墨斯（Hermes）：神使，速度
Jupiter\'s-day：（木）朱庇特（Jupiter）雷电
Venus\'-day（金）:维纳斯（Venus）对应阿佛洛狄忒（Aphrodite）：美丽爱神
Saturn\'s-day（土）。

在向日耳曼人传播后，他们又按自己的神（北欧神话）对应罗马神，更改了对应名称
Tuesday：Tyr(Tius,Tiw)，战神；
Wednesday：Woden，对应Mercury，据说是Thor天然对应雷神，Woden就对应Mercury了
Thursday：Thor，对应Jupiter雷神
Friday：Frigg，是爱情女神，对应Venus
