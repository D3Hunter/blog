A `coating` is a covering that is applied to the surface of an object, usually referred to as the `substrate`.

`solvent`: The liquid in which a solute is dissolved to form a solution.

`solution`: A liquid mixture in which the minor component (the `solute`) is uniformly distributed within the major component (the `solvent`)

`varnish`: Resin dissolved in a liquid for applying on wood, metal, or other materials to form a hard, clear, shiny surface when dry.

`resin`: A solid or liquid synthetic organic polymer used as the basis of plastics, adhesives, varnishes, or other products.

`polymer`: A substance which has a molecular structure built up chiefly or completely from a large number of similar units bonded together, e.g. many synthetic organic materials used as plastics and resins.

`adhesive`: A substance used for sticking objects or materials together; glue.

`superhydrophobic`: Repelling water to the degree that droplets do not flatten but roll off instead.

`force`: An influence tending to change the motion of a body or produce motion or stress in a stationary body. The magnitude of such an influence is often calculated by multiplying the `mass` of the body by its `acceleration`.

`Nomenclature` The devising or choosing of names for things, especially in a science or other discipline.

The `mole` is the unit of measurement for amount of substance in the International System of Units (`SI`).

In chemistry, the `molar mass` `M` is a physical property defined as the mass of a given substance (chemical element or chemical compound) divided by the amount of substance.[1] The base SI unit for molar mass is `kg/mol`. However, for historical reasons, molar masses are almost always expressed in `g/mol`.

`Amount of substance` is a standard-defined quantity that measures the size of an ensemble of particles, such as atoms, molecules, electrons, and other particles. It is sometimes referred to as `chemical amount`. The International System of Units (SI) defines the amount of substance to be proportional to the number of entities present. The SI unit for amount of substance is the `mole`. It has the unit symbol `mol`.

A `chemical formula` is a way of presenting information about the chemical proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound or molecule, using chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (−) signs.

A `chemical equation` is the symbolic representation of a `chemical  reaction` in the form of symbols and formulae, wherein the reactant entities are given on the left-hand side and the product entities on the right-hand side.

An `aqueous solution` is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is mostly shown in `chemical equations` by appending `(aq)` to the relevant `chemical formula`. 

In `meteorology`, `precipitation` is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity.

`meteorology`, The branch of science concerned with the processes and phenomena of the atmosphere, especially as a means of forecasting the weather.

`Condensation` is the change of the physical state of matter from gas phase into liquid phase, and is the reverse of `vapourisation`.

`base`, A substance capable of reacting with an acid to form a salt and water, or (more broadly) of accepting or neutralizing hydrogen ions.

The `limiting reagent` (or limiting reactant, LR) in a chemical reaction is the substance that is totally consumed when the chemical reaction is complete.

`Redox` (short for `reduction–oxidation reaction`) (pronunciation: /ˈrɛdɒks/ redoks or /ˈriːdɒks/ reedoks[1]) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed.

`Stoichiometry` /ˌstɔɪkiˈɒmɪtri/ is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.
