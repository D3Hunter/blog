Requirements files
    pip install -r requirements.txt

use 'import modu' over 'from modu import sqrt' over 'from modu import *' to
    increase readalibity and understandability
Any directory with an __init__.py file is considered a Python package.
In Python, everything is an object, and can be handled as such.
Carefully isolating functions with context and side-effects from functions with logic (called pure functions)
A decorator is a function or a class that wraps (or decorates) a function or a method.
A context manager is a Python object that provides extra contextual information to an action.
Dynamic typing
Python has two kinds of built-in or user-defined types. Mutable and immutable types
    Typical mutables are lists and dictionaries. tuple and string is immutables
    字符串拼接用list的join更高效：list comprehensions，如果个数固定用‘+’也可以
We are all responsible users: no explicit 'private'
PEP 8 is the de-facto code style guide for Python.

Idioms
    Unpacking
        for index, item in enumerate(some_list):
        a, b = b, a
        a, (b, c) = 1, (2, 3)
    Create an ignored variable
        basename, __, ext = filename.rpartition('.')
    Create a length-N list of the same thing
        four_nones = [None] * 4
    Create a length-N list of lists¶
        Because lists are mutable, the * operator (as above) will create a list of N references to the same list
        four_lists = [[] for __ in xrange(4)]
    Create a string from a list
        letters = ['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']
        word = ''.join(letters)
    Searching for an item in a collection
        use set/directories which use hashtable for better performance
        'list''ll iterate whole list

Conventions
    Check if variable equals a constant
        if attr:
        if not attr:
        if attr is None:
    Access a Dictionary Element
        Don’t use the dict.has_key() method. Instead, use x in d syntax,
        or pass a default argument to dict.get().
    Short Ways to Manipulate Lists
        List comprehensions provide a powerful, concise way to work with lists.
        Also, the map() and filter() functions can perform operations on lists
        using a different, more concise syntax.
    Read From a File
        Use the with open syntax to read from files.
    Line Continuations
        A better solution is to use parentheses around your elements.

python -m site --user-site

basic:
    command line argument: import sys; len(sys.argv); sys.argv
    [] list, () tuple, {} dict
    str.split(strtok)
    and or not
    def functionname( parameters ):
    for x in range(5): 或者xrange
    time.sleep(t)
    SimpleHTTPServer: This class serves files from the current directory and below
    print '%d, %f' % (1, 2.3)
    merged_list = list1 + list2

    * unpacks the sequence/collection into positional arguments
        def sum(a, b):
            return a + b
        values = (1, 2)
        s = sum(*values)       ======      s = sum(1, 2)
        values = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
        s = sum(**values)      ======      s = sum(1, 2)
    需要f = staticmethod(f)才能成为static method，同理f = classmethod(f)
    sys.argv 0为脚本
    pip install virtualenvwrapper
    TypeError: __call__() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
        pip install setuptools==33.1.1
    访问全局变量，需要在方法中指定：global variable

method & function
    A method is on an object.
    A function is independent of an object.
    For Java, there are only methods.
    For C, there are only functions.
    For C++/python it would depend on whether or not you're in a class.

descriptor
    In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with “binding behavior”,
        one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor protocol.
    both __get__() and __set__(), it is considered a data descriptor
    only define __get__() are called non-data descriptors
    Data and non-data descriptors differ in how overrides are calculated
        with respect to entries in an instance’s dictionary.
