An `updo` is a hair style that involves arranging the hair so that it is pointing up. It can be as simple as a ponytail, but is more commonly associated with more elaborate styles intended for special occasions such as a prom or wedding.

A `bun` is a type of hairstyle wherein the hair is pulled back from the face, twisted or plaited, and wrapped in a circular coil around itself, typically on top or back of the head or just above the neck.
`Double or pigtail buns` are often called odango(お団子 odango) or called niújiǎotóu (牛角头).
The `messy bun` is a quick, and cool hairstyle. The `casual, undone, messy updo` hairstyle is also extremely versatile. It works for anything from a quick run to the grocery store to your cousin’s wedding.

The `beehive` is a hairstyle in which long hair is piled up in a conical shape on the top of the head and slightly backwards pointing, giving some resemblance to the shape of a traditional beehive. It is also known as the B-52 due to a resemblance to the distinctive nose of the Boeing B-52 Strategic Bomber.

`Chignons` are generally achieved by pinning the hair into a knot at the nape of the neck or at the back of the head, but there are many different variations of the style. They are usually secured with accessories such as barrettes or hairpins. Chignons are frequently worn for special occasions, like weddings and formal dances, but the basic chignon is also worn for everyday casual wear.

A `French twist` is a common "`updo`" hair styling technique. It is created by gathering the hair in one hand and twisting the hair upwards until it turns in on itself against the head. It is then secured with barrettes, combs, hair sticks and/or hairpins. It was popular in the late 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s.

A `ponytail` is a hairstyle in which some, most or all of the hair on the head is pulled away from the face, gathered and secured at the back of the head with a hair tie, clip, or other similar device and allowed to hang freely from that point. It gets its name from its resemblance to the tail of a pony.
