A URI is a uniform resource identifier while a URL is a uniform resource locator. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but not every URI is a URL. This is because another subcategory of URIs, uniform resource names(URNs), which name resources but do not specify how to locate them. The mailto, news, and isbn URIs shown above are examples of URNs.
