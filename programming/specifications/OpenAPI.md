The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

`OpenAPI Specification 2.0`, which is identical to the `Swagger 2.0` specification before it was renamed to "OpenAPI Specification", as well as the Swagger 1.2 and Swagger 2.0 specifications.
