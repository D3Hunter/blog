### orthogonality
orthogonality means that operations change just one thing without affecting others. no side effect. two thing is orthogonal if their product is zero.

Orthogonal design is the union of two principles, cohesion and coupling.
Orthogonal designn requires highly cohesive components, keep your components small and focused, and requires software components to be loosely coupled to one another.
coupling is used to describe the relationship between components.
