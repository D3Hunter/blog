## problem solving
George Pólya's 1945 book, How to Solve It

A `heuristic technique`, or a `heuristic`, is any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. Examples:
- trial and error
    - repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success
    - origin: associated with various trades where quantities were measured by comparison to the width or length of a thumb
- rule of thumb
    - an easily learned and easily applied procedure or standard, based on practical experience rather than theory.
- educated guess.
- If you are having difficulty understanding a problem, try `drawing a picture`.
- If you can't find a solution, try `assuming that you have a solution and seeing what you can derive from that` ("working backward").
- If the problem is abstract, try examining a concrete example.
- Try solving a more general problem first (the "inventor's paradox": the more ambitious plan may have more chances of success).

### problem-solving strategies
- `Abstraction`: solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
- `Analogy`: using a solution that solves an analogous problem
- `Brainstorming`: (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
- `Divide and conquer`: breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
- `Hypothesis testing`: assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption
- `Lateral thinking`: approaching solutions indirectly and creatively
    - four such techniques
        - `Awareness`: Being aware of the way the brain processes information
        - `Random stimulation`
        - `Alternatives`
        - `Alteration`: This technique consists of the deliberate alteration of available options
- `Means-ends analysis`: choosing an action at each step to move closer to the goal. 手段与目的分析
- `Method of focal objects`: synthesizing seemingly non-matching characteristics of different objects into something new. 焦点对象法又称焦点客体法
- `Morphological analysis`: assessing the output and interactions of an entire system. 形态分析
- `Proof`: try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
- `Reduction`: transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist. 简化
- `Research`: employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
- `Root cause analysis`: identifying the cause of a problem
    - widely used in IT operations, telecommunications, industrial process control, accident analysis (e.g., in aviation, rail transport, or nuclear plants), medicine (for medical diagnosis), healthcare industry
    - `RCA` can be decomposed into four steps
        - Identify and describe the problem clearly.
        - Establish a timeline from the normal situation up to the time the problem occurred.
        - Distinguish between the root cause and other causal factors (e.g., using event correlation).
        - Establish a causal graph between the root cause and the problem.
- `Trial-and-error`: testing possible solutions until the right one is found
