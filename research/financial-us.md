`Tax returns` in the United States are reports filed with the `Internal Revenue Service (IRS)` or with the state or local tax collection agency containing information used to calculate income tax or other taxes.
`Information returns` are reports used to transmit information about income, receipts or other matters that may affect tax liabilities. A company, employer, or party which has paid income (or, in a few cases, proceeds that may ultimately be determined not to be income) to a taxpayer is required to file the applicable information return directly with the IRS
`Amended return:` In the United States, taxpayers may file an amended return with the Internal Revenue Service to correct errors reported on a previous income tax return.
`gross profit` â€“ sometimes called `sales profit`, is the difference between the revenue earned and the cost of goods sold (COGS) for a given period of time.
`Operating income` is essentially `gross profit` minus fixed `operating expenses` and `depreciation`. `Operating expenses` include utilities and supplies. Dividing `operating income` by `revenue` for the period returns the `operating margin`
Neither `operating income` or `gross profit` consider variables that management has little control over, such as `taxes` or broader `economic conditions`.
A `deferred income tax` is a liability recorded on the `balance sheet` that results from a difference in income recognition between tax laws and accounting methods.
`deferred income tax asset` represent the future economic benefit expected to be received because income taxes were charged in excessed based on GAAP income.
The most common situation that generates a deferred income tax liability is from differences in depreciation methods.
A `balance sheet` is a financial statement that summarizes a company's `assets`, `liabilities` and `shareholders' equity` at a specific point in time.

Income and profit are synonyms when referring to financial statements and financial accounting.
