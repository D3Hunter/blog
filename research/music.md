While "`new-age`" music can be difficult to define, journalist Steven Rea described the genre as "music that is acoustic, electronic, jazzy, folky and incorporates classical and pop elements, Eastern and Latin influences, exotic instrumentation and environmental sound effects."

### concepts
- `New-age` music is a genre of music intended to create artistic inspiration, relaxation, and optimism. It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, reading as a method of stress management to bring about a state of `ecstasy` rather than `trance`, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their home or other environments, and is associated with `environmentalism` and `New Age spirituality`.
- `Light music` is a less-serious form of Western `classical music`, which originated in the 18th and 19th centuries and continues today. Its heyday was in the mid‑20th century. The style is `through-composed`, usually shorter orchestral pieces and suites designed to appeal to a wider context and audience than more sophisticated forms such as the `concerto`, the `symphony` and the `opera`.
- `through-composed` music is relatively continuous, non-sectional, or non-repetitive music.
- `Strophic form` – also called verse-repeating form, chorus form, AAA song form, or one-part song form – is a song structure in which all verses or stanzas of the text are sung to the same music. The opposite of `strophic form`, with new music written for every stanza, is called `through-composed`.
- In poetry, a `stanza` (/ˈstænzə/; from Italian stanza [ˈstantsa], "room") is a grouped set of lines within a poem, usually set off from other stanzas by a blank line or indentation. In music, groups of lines are typically referred to as `verses`.
- A `symphony` is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often written by composers for `orchestra`.
- An `orchestra` (/ˈɔːrkɪstrə/; Italian: [orˈkɛstra]) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which combines instruments from different families
- A `concerto` (/kənˈtʃɛərtoʊ/; plural concertos, or concerti from the Italian plural) is a musical composition generally composed of three movements, in which either `one solo instrument` or `a group of soloists` (concertino) is accompanied by an `orchestra` or `concert band`.
- `Opera` is a form of `theatre` in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers, but is distinct from `musical theater`
- `Musical theatre` is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance.
- `Ambient music` is a genre of music that emphasizes tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm.
    - Ambient music did not achieve large commercial success, being criticized as having a "boring" and "over-intellectual" sound. Nevertheless, it has attained a certain degree of acclaim throughout the years, especially in the Internet age.
- `Art music` (alternatively called `classical music`, cultivated music, serious music, and canonic music) is music considered to be of `high aesthetic` value. It typically implies advanced structural and theoretical considerations or a written musical tradition.
- `Popular music` is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both `art music` and `traditional or "folk" music`.
- `Hip hop music`, also called `hip-hop` or `rap music`, is a genre of popular music developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans and Latino Americans in the Bronx borough of New York City in the 1970s. It consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies `rapping`, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted.
- `Folk music` includes `traditional folk music` and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. `Traditional folk music` has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with `commercial` and `classical` styles.
- `Easy listening` (sometimes known as `mood music`) is a popular music genre and radio format that was most popular during the 1950s to 1970s.
- `Contemporary R&B` (also known as simply `R&B`) is a music genre that combines elements of rhythm and blues, pop, soul, funk, hip hop and electronic music.
- `Rhythm and blues`, commonly abbreviated as `R&B`, is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s.
- `Blues` is a music genre and musical form which was originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1870s by African-Americans from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs, and spirituals.
    - The `blues form`, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern
    -  the blues is essentially a vocal form. Blues songs are lyrical rather than narrative; blues singers are expressing feelings rather than telling stories.
- `Rock music` is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s
    - The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar
- `Jazz` is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.

### Antonio Lucio Vivaldi
`Antonio Lucio Vivaldi` (UK: /vɪˈvældi/, US: /vɪˈvɑːldi, -ˈvɔːl-/, Italian: [anˈtɔːnjo ˈluːtʃo viˈvaldi]; 4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was an Italian `Baroque musical composer`, virtuoso violinist, teacher, and Roman Catholic priest. Born in Venice, the capital of the Venetian Republic, he is regarded as one of the greatest `Baroque composers`, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental `concertos`, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as `sacred choral` works and more than forty `operas`. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as the `Four Seasons`.
