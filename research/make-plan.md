### Create plan
1. Keep a record of everything.
    - As you work through your action plan, keep notes of everything.
2. Know what you want to do.
    - The less clear you are about what you want to do, the less effective your plan will be. Try to specifically define what you want to achieve as early as possible — preferably before starting your project.
3. Be specific and realistic in your planning.
    - Having a specific goal is just the beginning: you need to be specific and realistic in every aspect of your project
    - is all about pro-actively reducing stress that can accompany poorly planned projects such as missed deadlines and exhausting long hours.
4. Set measurable milestones.
    - Create milestones easily by `starting at the end` (the accomplishment of the goal) and working your way backwards to your present day and circumstances.
    - Having milestones can help you — and if applicable, your team — `stay motivated` by breaking the work into smaller chunks and tangible goals so that you don’t need to wait until the project is completely finished to feel as though you’ve accomplished something.
    - Don’t leave `too much time` or `too little time` between milestones — `spacing them two weeks apart` has been found to be effective.
5. Break large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.
    - If you’re feeling `overwhelmed` by a large task, you can help `ease your anxiety` and make it `feel more doable` by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks.
6. Make scheduled lists.
    - Make a list of tasks that you need to complete in order to hit your milestones. A list on its own will not be effective — you `must write this list into a timeline` associated `with specific, realistic actions.`
7. Put timelines on everything.
    - Without specific time frames and deadlines, work will definitely expand to fill the time allotted, and some tasks may never get completed.
8. Mark things off as you go.
    - Marking things off as you go will not only feel satisfying, it will help you keep on track lest you forget what you’ve already done.
9. Don’t stop until you’ve reached your final goal.
10. Change the date if you must, but never give up on your goal.
    - Occasionally, circumstances or unforeseen events can arise that throw a wrench in your ability to meet deadlines, complete tasks and achieve your goal.
    - If this happens, do not get discouraged – revise your plan and continue working to meet targets and move forward.
### Manage time
1. Get yourself a good planner.
    - Studies have shown that physically writing things down (i.e. with pen and paper) will make you more likely to do them.[2] For this reason, you may be best off using a physical planner to plan your time out.
2. Avoid to-do lists.
    - To-do lists are not as effective as scheduling out your tasks. When you schedule your tasks, you make the time to get them done.
3. Learn how to time block.
    - Blocking out your time helps you get a more realistic idea of how much time you actually have in a day. Start with your highest-priority tasks and work backwards.
    - Do this for your whole week. Having a broader view of how your days will add up will help you refine your schedule to be as productive as possible.[4]
    - Some experts even suggest having at least a general idea of what your whole month will look like.
4. Schedule time for leisure and breaks.
    - Studies have shown that scheduling even your free time can help increase your satisfaction with life.
    - It has also been proven that long work hours (50+ hours a week) in fact make you less productive.[8]
    - scheduling small, “strategic renewals” (i.e. workouts, brief naps, meditation, stretching) into your day will boost your productivity and overall health.
5. Set aside time to plan your week out.
    - Many experts suggest scheduling time right at the start of your week to sit down and plan your week.
6. Know that every day does not have to look the same.
    - You can split up tasks into only 1 or 2 days a week — sometimes it’s even helpful to break up tasks as you can return to them with a fresh perspective.
7. Schedule for problems.
    - Build a little bit of extra time into every block that will account for a slow work day or an unanticipated interruption.
    - A good rule of thumb is to give yourself double the time you expect a task to take — particularly when you're just starting out.
8. Be flexible and gentle with yourself.
    - Especially as you’re starting out, be prepared to tweak your schedule as you go. It’s part of the learning process. 
9. Disconnect.
    - Set times in your day where you’ll check your emails or social media.
    - Be strict with yourself, as it’s possible to lose hours just checking in every few minutes here and there.
    - This includes turning off your phone, if possible — at least for periods where you really want to focus on work.
10. Do less.
    - This relates to disconnecting. Figure out the most important things in your day — the ones that will help you achieve your goals, and focus on those.
    - De-prioritize the less important things that fragment your day: emails, mindless paperwork, etc.
### Staying Motivated
1. Be positive.
    - Staying positive is fundamental to achieving your goals.
    - Believe in yourself and the people around you. Counter any negative self-talk with positive affirmations.
    - In addition to being positive, you will benefit from surrounding yourself with positive people.
    - Research has shown that over time, you adopt the habits of those with whom you spend the most time, so choose your company wisely.
2. Reward yourself.[17] This is particularly important to do each time you hit a milestone.
3. Track your progress. Research has shown that progress is the highest motivator
4. Go to bed early and get up early. When you read about the schedules of highly productive people, a large percentage of them start their days early. 
5. Give yourself downtime. Taking breaks is imperative to staying motivated. If you are always working, you’ll wind up exhausting yourself. Taking breaks is a pro-active way to prevent yourself from getting exhausted and losing time that you don’t want to lose.
6. Know that it won’t be easy. Things worth having are rarely easy to get. You may have to resolve a lot of issues or work through some things as you work toward your goal. Accept them as they come.
