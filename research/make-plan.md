### Create plan
1. Keep a record of everything.
    - As you work through your action plan, keep notes of everything.
2. Know what you want to do.
    - The less clear you are about what you want to do, the less effective your plan will be. Try to specifically define what you want to achieve as early as possible — preferably before starting your project.
3. Be specific and realistic in your planning.
    - Having a specific goal is just the beginning: you need to be specific and realistic in every aspect of your project
    - is all about pro-actively reducing stress that can accompany poorly planned projects such as missed deadlines and exhausting long hours.
4. Set measurable milestones.
    - Create milestones easily by `starting at the end` (the accomplishment of the goal) and working your way backwards to your present day and circumstances.
    - Having milestones can help you — and if applicable, your team — `stay motivated` by breaking the work into smaller chunks and tangible goals so that you don’t need to wait until the project is completely finished to feel as though you’ve accomplished something.
    - Don’t leave `too much time` or `too little time` between milestones — `spacing them two weeks apart` has been found to be effective.
5. Break large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.
    - If you’re feeling `overwhelmed` by a large task, you can help `ease your anxiety` and make it `feel more doable` by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks.
6. Make scheduled lists.
    - Make a list of tasks that you need to complete in order to hit your milestones. A list on its own will not be effective — you `must write this list into a timeline` associated `with specific, realistic actions.`
7. Put timelines on everything.
    - Without specific time frames and deadlines, work will definitely expand to fill the time allotted, and some tasks may never get completed.
8. Mark things off as you go.
    - Marking things off as you go will not only feel satisfying, it will help you keep on track lest you forget what you’ve already done.
9. Don’t stop until you’ve reached your final goal.
10. Change the date if you must, but never give up on your goal.
    - Occasionally, circumstances or unforeseen events can arise that throw a wrench in your ability to meet deadlines, complete tasks and achieve your goal.
    - If this happens, do not get discouraged – revise your plan and continue working to meet targets and move forward.
### Manage time
1. Get yourself a good planner.
    - Studies have shown that physically writing things down (i.e. with pen and paper) will make you more likely to do them.[2] For this reason, you may be best off using a physical planner to plan your time out.
2. Avoid to-do lists.
    - To-do lists are not as effective as scheduling out your tasks. When you schedule your tasks, you make the time to get them done.
3. Learn how to time block.
    - Blocking out your time helps you get a more realistic idea of how much time you actually have in a day. Start with your highest-priority tasks and work backwards.
    - Do this for your whole week. Having a broader view of how your days will add up will help you refine your schedule to be as productive as possible.[4]
    - Some experts even suggest having at least a general idea of what your whole month will look like.
4. Schedule time for leisure and breaks.
    - Studies have shown that scheduling even your free time can help increase your satisfaction with life.
    - It has also been proven that long work hours (50+ hours a week) in fact make you less productive.[8]
    - scheduling small, “strategic renewals” (i.e. workouts, brief naps, meditation, stretching) into your day will boost your productivity and overall health.
