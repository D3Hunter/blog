### high-heeled shoes
High-heeled shoes give the optical illusion of a longer, slimmer leg, a smaller foot, and overall greater height. They alter the wearer's posture and gait, flexing the calf muscles and making the bust and buttocks more prominent.

All high heels counter the natural functionality of the foot, sometimes causing skeletal and muscular problems if users wear them excessively; such shoes are a common cause of venous complaints such as pain, fatigue, and heavy-feeling legs, and have been found to provoke venous hypertension in the lower limbs.

A `stiletto heel` is a long, thin, high heel found on some `boots` and `shoes`. It is named after the stiletto dagger, the phrase being primarily recorded in the early 1930s. `Stiletto-style heels` 5 cm (2.0 in) or shorter are called `kitten heels`.

#### Types of Heels
- Kitten Heels
- Pumps: Also known as simply high heels, pumps are usually wider and between 2 and 3 inches in height. They're typically low cut around the front.
- Stilettos: The highest of all the high heels, stilettos can reach up to 8 inches.
    - Note: many stilettos are also platforms due to the height (see below for platforms).
- Ankle Strap Heels: The height of the heel can vary, but the one common denominator is the strap that goes around the ankle, making the heels more secure and comfortable to walk in.
- Wedge Heels: there is no separation from the heel to the sole.
- Wedge Sandals: While they have the same type of heel as a wedge heel, wedge sandals have a more open, sandal upper.
- Cone heels: Wider at the sole of the foot and narrower at the base, cone heels form what you might expect: a cone.
- Sling Back Heels: Unlike ankle strap heels, the sling back heel just has a strap that goes around the back of the achilles heel.
- Platform Heels: You can see platform heels from short to tall. The main thing that makes them platform is the part of the shoe under the sole is thicker.
- High Heel Sandals: With varying heights, a high heel sandal is anything that has any of the heel types listed here (high, stiletto, kitten), but with a sandal upper.
- Peep Toe Heels: Somewhat of a tease, peep toe heels come in all shapes and sizes. All they need is for a pop of your colorful toenails to show to be a peep toe!
- Cork High Heels: These heels simply refer to the cork material used to make them. They can vary in height and style
- High Heeled Boots
- Ankle Booties: high heeled booties, or ankle booties, are great for spring or fall days when a full boot is overkill.
- Spool Heels: If you think of a spool of thread, you may understand the concept of spool heels. The heel is thicker at the sole of the foot, narrow in the middle, and then comes back out at the base.
- Mules: Mule heels are any type of heel that comes up high over the top of the foot. You could have an open or closed to mule; the height of the heel can vary.
- Ballroom Dance Shoes: Strappy shoes that typically have an enclosed back and ankle strap, ...They're low enough to be stable but high enough to provide a little vertical lift. They're becoming more popular at weddings.
- Cut Out Heels: Getting more on the funky, cool side of high heel types, cut out heels are any type of heel that has a portion of the upper cut out for effect.
- Corset Heels: Similar to a mule style of heel or a bootie, the difference with a corset heel is that the two sides are tied together as a traditional corset would be.(另一个关键词是lace up)
- French Heels: Also known as Louis Heels or Pompador Heels, these are similar to spool heels wherein they are short but have some curve to the heel.
- Oxfords: The traditional Oxford has that academy look with a flat heel. But lately, we're seeing Oxford heels come on the scene. The heel is still flat at the base, but with more height than a traditional Oxford.
- Chunky Heels: This is the general term for any heel with a wider base that is typically square. They're usually on the short to medium side, and provide more stability than traditional high heels or stilettos.
- Comma Heels: Think of the comma. Yes, we're referring to the punctuation mark. Now line that up with the heel of a shoe, and you have a comma heel!
- Espadrille Heels: Somewhat new on the fashion scene, Espadrille shoes have a fabric upper and a plaited fiber sole, made popular worldwide by Toms. Espadrille heels are a take on this traditional flat, and can have a `heel` or `wedge` base.
- Fantasy Heels: Here's the wildcard heel type to cover all of the crazy designs out there.
