### Allergic rhinitis
`Allergic rhinitis` is a diagnosis associated with a group of symptoms affecting the `nose`. These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as `dust`, `animal dander`, or `pollen`. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to.

`allergic rhinitis` due to plant pollens is commonly called `hay fever` or `seasonal allergy`.

Plants that cause hay fever are `trees`, `grasses`, and `weeds`. Their pollen is carried by the `wind`. (`Flower pollen` is carried by `insects` and does not cause hay fever.)

The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not.
- `Hot`, `dry`, `windy days` are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air.
- `cool`, `damp`, `rainy days`, most pollen is `washed` to the ground.
