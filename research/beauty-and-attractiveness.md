### about beauty
`There’s no getting around it. In this world, you’re better off being good-looking`. At all ages and in all walks of life, attractive people are judged more favorably, treated better, and cut more slack. Mothers give more affection to attractive babies. Teachers favor more attractive students and judge them as smarter. Attractive adults get paid more for their work and have better success in dating and mating. And juries are less likely to find attractive people guilty and recommend lighter punishments when they do.

There is no doubt that beauty (which here means both male and female attractiveness) is to some extent in the eye of the beholder, but across individuals and across cultures there is nevertheless considerable agreement about what makes a pretty or handsome face, and the evidence strongly counters the conventional wisdom that attractiveness preferences are mainly acquired through life experience.

#### Truth in Beauty
Evolutionary psychology holds that faces really are windows onto certain fundamental and important characteristics indicative of a person’s quality as a romantic partner and as a mate — `qualities of health and genes`, and even `character`.

An attractive man, in the eyes of female experimental participants, is generally one with `relatively prominent cheekbones and eyebrow ridges` and a `relatively long lower face`. Likewise, `prominent cheekbones`, `large eyes`, `small nose`, a `taller forehead`, `smooth skin`, and an `overall young or even childlike appearance` add to women’s allure in the eyes of male raters.

We are programmed to be drawn to strong indicators of maleness (for women) and femaleness (for men) partly because `they reflect an individual’s health`. The reason hormones equate to health is somewhat counterintuitive. `High levels of sex hormones during puberty actually suppress the immune system`, raising vulnerability to disease and infection. It sounds like a bad thing. But when a person with a particularly “male” or “female” face makes it to adulthood with all his or her health intact, it means that the person has `withstood the potentially debilitating influence of those high hormones`. In other words it signifies a more robust constitution.

#### ‘Your Symmetry Lights Up the Room’(对称)
Some asymmetries (called `directional asymmetries`) are common across the population – for example, the left side of most people’s faces is slightly larger than the right. But many asymmetries, called `fluctuating asymmetries`, arise when one’s unfolding genetic program is perturbed during development, for instance by parasites or other environmental challenges. `The slings and arrows of life’s fortunes can literally knock our faces off of kilter, just like a punch to the nose`. A symmetrical face, like a particularly masculine or feminine one, is `a sign of having stood up better to life’s figurative schoolyard beatings`.

In a beautiful face, we are really seeing the `artistry of good genes`. People prefer symmetrical faces even when they can’t actually perceive the symmetry – that is, when only face halves are presented. It may be that symmetry covaries with other desirable characteristics that reflect the same genetic endowment and overall health

`Less obvious is that a pretty or handsome face is also generally one that is, well, average`. When presented with individual faces and a composite of those individual faces, participants will judge the composite as more attractive than the individual, more distinctive faces.

`Averageness, like symmetry, reflects a favorable genetic endowment. Those with average features are less likely to be carrying harmful mutations.`

#### In the Sex of the Beholder（影响判断的客观因素）
Males may place greater importance on physical beauty when it comes to mate choice, while females also attend to characteristics like power and status. `But a number of factors contribute to how much — and when — male face characteristics matter to women.`

One factor is a `woman’s own attractiveness`: Preference for masculine and symmetrical features has been shown to be higher for women who regard themselves as more attractive. Another is `time of the month`: The degree of women’s preferences for different attractive qualities fluctuates strikingly across the ovulatory cycle.

`Humans, like many other species, are socially monogamous but not necessarily sexually monogamous`. When sex might result in getting pregnant, it’s health and fertility that are particularly desirable in a mate. But good genes in the sense of physical health is not the same as good genes in the sense of character, and what makes a good sperm donor may not make the best long-term, nurturing, helpful life partner. `The flip side of high testosterone is an increased tendency toward aggression and antisocial behavior, a tendency to compete rather than help`. Thus a male with less testosterone, indicated by less masculine features, may invest more in caring for offspring (whether or not he’s the biological father) and so may be better to have around for the long term.

#### A Thousand Ships（对理智的影响）
We now know that there’s truth to the idea that `men make worse decisions when exposed to female beauty`....looking at photographs of attractive women (but not unattractive women) caused a `significant increase in delay discounting` in men — that is, `choosing a smaller immediate reward over a larger delayed one`....`Interestingly, viewing attractive men did not influence women’s decisions.`

#### Beautify Yourself
`Beauty is unfair`. Not everyone can be born with great genes. Not everyone can be born symmetrical. Not everyone can be born enticingly, well, average. `But obviously there are many factors contributing to attractiveness that are potentially under our control`.

1. For women, makeup does Beauty_make-up_articlehave a strong effect.
2. Getting enough beauty sleep is something everyone can do to up their beauty quotient.
3. And then there are the emotions we project through our faces. Not surprising, positive emotions increase attractiveness.

So here’s the timeless message of psychological science: `Be beautiful—or, as beautiful as you can`. Smile and sleep and do whatever else you can do to make your face a reward. Among its other social benefits, attractiveness actually invites people to learn what you are made of, in other respects than just genetic fitness....`attractive people are actually judged more accurately—at least, closer to a subject’s own self-assessments—than are the less attractive`, because it draws others to go beyond the initial impression. `“People do judge a book by its cover,”` the researchers write, `“but a beautiful cover prompts a closer reading.”`

### English Words
- The face that `launched a thousand ships`: A reference to the mythological figure Helen of Troy (or some would say, to Aphrodite). Her abduction by Paris was said to be the reason for a fleet of a thousand ships to be launched into battle, initiating the Trojan Wars.
- `cut someone some slack`: you are less critical of their behaviour or performance than usual because you know they are in a difficult situation. When you're new at a job, colleagues and bosses cut you some slack. They forgive minor mistakes because you're new.
- If `beauty is in the eye of the beholder`, then the person who is observing gets to decide what is beautiful. A common saying is "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder," which means beauty doesn't exist on its own but is created by observers.
- `Carry-oneself`: To move, especially emphasising the manner in which one moves. (idiomatic) To behave, especially with respect to how one's speech, body language, facial expressions, and grooming convey one's opinion concerning oneself.
- `Slings and arrows` are bad things that happen to you and that are not your fault.
