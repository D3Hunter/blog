Porter's five forces include three forces from 'horizontal' competition--the threat of substitute products or services, the threat of established rivals, and the threat of new entrants--and two others from 'vertical' competition--the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.
### Threat of new entrants
- The existence of barriers to entry (patents, rights, etc.) 进入门槛
- Government policy。政策
- Capital requirements。资本需求
- Absolute cost：Refers to the cost of producing your product or service
- Cost disadvantages independent of size。护城河
- Economies of scale。规模化
- Product differentiation。产品差异化
- Brand equity。品牌
- Switching costs。转换成本
- Expected retaliation。Types of retaliation include dropping prices, offering increased incentives to buy, offering additional service for the same price.
- Access to distribution channels。渠道
- Customer loyalty to established brands。客户忠诚度
- Industry profitability。行业盈利能力
- Network effect
### Industry Rivalry
- Industry Growth Rate：需求饱和或下降，会提高竞争度
- High Fixed Cost：高固定资产，维持产量／规模，会提高竞争度
- Intermittent Over Capacity ：Refers products whose demand is less than supply for relatively short periods
- Product Differences
- Brand Identity
- Switching Costs
- Informational Complexity：Refers to the how easy or hard it is to understanding your products. 
- Concentration and balance：行业集中度
- Industry Commitment 
- Exit Barriers
### Threat of Substitute Products
- The relative price performance of substitutes
- Switching costs	
- Buyer propensity to substitute：Refers to your customers loyalty to your product or service
### The Bargaining Power of Your Suppliers
- Differentiation of Inputs
- Switching Costs
- Substitute Products
- Supplier concentration relative to industry concentration：if the top 4 suppliers have 90% of the market then they can drive price if the top 4 have 30% of the market then you can drive price.
- Importance of volume to the supplier（产能一旦上去很难下降）
- Cost relative to the total purchases of the industry：占总成本的比例
- Impact of inputs on cost or differentiation：Refers to the role your supplier’s product plays in differentiating your product or service.
- Threat of forward integration：Refers to a supplier choosing to become a competitor of yours
### The bargaining power of your customers
In general terms the more powerful your customers are the less profitable your industry will be.
- The differentiation of outputs
- Switching costs
- Presence of Substitutes
- Industry concentration relative to buyer concentration
- Importance of volume to buyers
- Cost relative to total buyer purchases：购买成本（单价）
- Impact of outputs on the cost of differentiation：客户的产品对我方产品特性的依赖度
- Buyer information about supplier products：产品透明度
- Buyer profitability
- Decision makers incentives: 客户购买欲望
- Threat of backward integration
